# TEST

Test project to figure out what I'm doing wrong with that checklist component thats driving me crazy.

##Note

Hi Caleb,

It's driving me insane this worked for you, yet in a brand new laravel application this isn't working for me. I know there are a million ways to solve this and it's not complicated to do it any other way, however I want to get invested in using livewire. I just like the way it feels compared to inertia/vue, which I use regularly. This project allows me to contribute more to small community projects like our kids school board that are over worked or small community groups, by knocking off small and helpful tools in a few hours after I get the kids to bed.

I use a laravel-preset command of mine but I've stripped it all out except styles. I've futher made a shiney new laravel project with absolutely nothing and I always get the exact same error. I can push that up if it would help.

What I really want to know is what you are doing diffferntly than I am! If this was a bug or problem I'm game but if the same code works for someone else, that kind of destroys me a bit inside. Please let me know if you did use the middleware removal to get it working. Or if it just worked for you. And if this one just works for you. I've tried php 7.3 and 7.2 (7.3 is on all my servers). I've also tried livewire 3.21 and dev-master.


## Install

#### Noting here but just to remove errors
`touch database/database.sqlite`

`migrate`

#### composer and yarn (I use yarn, and I think I've edited this package.json)
`composer install`

`yarn run dev' or watch`

Hopefully there is no valet or homestead conflict for you. It's just called test. I should have renamed it :(

If you do don't forget to update webpack.mix.json if you are using watch.


Thanks.
